        Peninsula, the Cliffs of Moher, the Aran Islands, Galway, Connemara,
        Giant's Causeway, and the compelling city of Belfast. All along the way,
        Rick's guides will share their stories to draw you in to the Emerald
        Isle, and the friendliness of the people will surely steal your heart.
